# Python Data Structures Collection

This repository contains professional and well-documented implementations of fundamental and advanced data structures in Python.  
Each data structure is implemented with clean code, detailed comments, and example usage for easy understanding and practical use.

| File Name                | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `doubly_linked_list.py`  | Doubly Linked List supporting append, prepend, delete, and bidirectional traversal. |
| `prefix_tree.py`         | Trie (Prefix Tree) implementation with insert, search, and prefix lookup.           |
| `preorder_traversal.py`  | AVL Tree implementation with insertion and self-balancing rotations.                |
| `binary_search.py`       | (Add your description here for this file)                                      |

## Features

- **Doubly Linked List:** Efficient insertion and deletion at both ends, supports forward and backward traversal.
- **Trie (Prefix Tree):** Fast prefix-based searches, useful for autocomplete and dictionary implementations.
- **AVL Tree:** Self-balancing binary search tree ensuring O(log n) time complexity for insert and search operations.
- **Binary Search:** (Add details about this script here.)

## Usage

Each data structure file includes a demonstration in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block.  
To test or use any structure, simply run the corresponding Python file:

```bash
python doubly_linked_list.py
python prefix_tree.py
python preorder_traversal.py
